# Package Puppet for various OS's.

Guide to building Puppet agents.

# Why build?

Since any reasonable modern OS have puppet in the standard repositories, why do we build the puppet software ourselves?

There are several reasons for this:

* Ruby depends on dynamically loaded libraries, for example zlib and openssl. By including these into the EIS puppet package we eliminate the risk of an OS patch to break puppet

* Some OSes in EIS scope does not provide puppet at all, or an older version. We can build EIS puppet for these

* We get the same version of puppet on all EIS managed servers, implying that we can use the same puppet language features for all clients

* The EIS puppet package installs in /opt/puppet, thus it is possible to have the OS puppet package installed simultaneously

* A tailor-made package fits our requirements better

# Prerequisites

The following components are used.

## Tools
* C compiler, usually gcc
* make and gmake
* perl
* fpm
* rpmbuild

### Solaris 10 x86:
    /usr/sfw/bin/gcc 3.4.3, patched with http://www.openssl.org/~appro/values.c to get usable openssl libs

### Solaris 10 sparc:
    /usr/sfw/bin/gcc 3.4.3

# Build Instructions
build.pl will auto detect the system that you are on and build for it.

    ./bin/build.pl

## To build without packaging

    ./bin/build.pl -wrap no

## To build specific packages
This would build only zlib and openssl. Notice the names match the variables from settings.pl

    ./bin/build.pl -packages zlib128,openssl101e

# Dump variables without building. Useful for debugging.

    ./bin/build.pl -dump

# repo layout

## `bin/`
scripts

### `build.pl`
main script that you run

### `settings.pl`
Default settings

### `settings.<platform>.pl`
Settings specific to that platform

## `builds/`
Directory where builds take place. Ignored by git

### `builds/logs/`
Logs to both of these files.

    logs/build.$hostname-<pid>
    logs/latest

### `builds/src.<hostname>/`
Packages are extracted and built here, under `<package_name>/`

### `builds/tgzs/`
Packages are downloaded here.

## `fpmtop/`

## `packages/`
Where built packages end up.

## `patches/`
Patches to source code


# Packaging
Solaris builds its own packages without FPM

Everything else, uses FPM.

* build.pl builds everything in /opt/puppet
* copies /opt/puppet to fpmtop/
* copies fpmtop/init.d to fpmtop/etc/init.d
* produces package

# OS Notes
## RedHat
Setup build environment.

    yum -y install rpm rpm-devel rpm-build gcc gcc-c++ automake autoconf libtool rubygems
    gem install -V fpm --no-ri --no-rdoc
